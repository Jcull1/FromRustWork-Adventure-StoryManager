Work done from Razbury Game Internship

The files in this project are part of the work I did during my Game Design Internship at Razbury Games. The projects goal was to build out their game mode management system in AWS that keeps track of unlocked zones and game modes for each player in a session. I first started with a data flow diagram that mapped out my code design, backend interactions, and all other necessary components. Secondly, I moved into working with the server side behavior in DynamoDB to keep track of which zones were unlocked. Next I worked on client side behavior to keep track of which game modes were unlocked in correspondences with the zone. With all this information obtained I then had to implement the corresponding UI elements availbility and display it for each player. 

***It's important to note that the files in this project are not the full C# game files. These code files are snippets of the work I did. I did not include the whole files because I do not want to take credit for other programmers work***
